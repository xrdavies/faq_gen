## General
- _1001._ **Why did you choose Polkadot network? What are the benefits to your project? Are you planning to launch your mainet or switch to other blockchains in the future?**

  Well-organized work, extensive infrastructure, easy interaction, scalability, customized flexibility – that's why we choose Polkadot for the Gear network. As we know Ethereum has faced the problem of scalability recently when we saw slow transaction processing and high fees. Polkadot works with multiple blockchains so the load can be distributed across separate networks. Each project included in the Polkadot ecosystem can create its blockchain with its flexible settings. At the same time, projects can easily interact with each other, despite the structure of their blockchain. Reliability, security and easy interaction between blockchains - it`s all provided by Polkadot so our platform will only benefit while connected to its ecosystem. Substrate framework has a lot of features oob -- consensus, networking and database layers, proven working by Kusama and Polkadot networks. You can read more about Polkadot on our last article https://medium.com/@gear_techs/why-the-polkadot-network-will-be-important-for-the-future-of-blockchain-technology-eb61f732fe9c

- _1002._ **Community is a key element for any project if you want to be successful, how can you ensure that the community is shared in governance? Do we need to place bets to get votes or do we need to run nodes?**

  Gear is a completely open-source project, so naturally you can easily check all our development on our GitHub. Once fully deployed, Gear will be fully governed by token owners. The vast majority of the tokens will be held by the community and incentivized teams. Gear will have a staking mechanism, so naturally, running a node will also be incentivized. This means that by owning tokens and staking, you will have governance rights.

- _1003._ **Can you list 1-3 killer features of this project that makes it ahead of its competitors? What is the competitive advantage your project has that you feel most confident about?**

  Gear is a smart-contract platform allowing anyone to run dApp in a few minutes! Key features: Programs (smart-contracts) run in WebAssembly VM (near-native code execution speed). Parallelizable architecture (even greater speed). Actor model for message-passing communications - secure, effective, clear, parallelizable and shardable. Fast smart-contract development speed - build dApps in minutes using intuitive Gear libraries. Gear provides pre-built secure solutions but also the freedom to build from scratch using Rust. Gear enables all Web3 use cases as well as can be used as middleware, be a part of Infrastructure, open APIs. We try to describe a in more details on our Wiki. https://wiki.gear-tech.io/

- _1004._ **As I know, strong backing and partnerships in the crypto market might bring huge benefits to new projects. During this point, can you tell us about the investors and partners of your project ? What benefits to the "GearTech' ecosystem do you expect from them?**

  We are backed by top VCs and angels that are heavily involved in the industry and eager to help us grow. Our investors mainly invest in infrastructure projects and typically hold their investment in a horizont of 5 and more years. They will share their experience and best practices as they supported and guided the leading projects in the blockchain ecosystem.

- _1005._ **People are always worried about the transaction speed because they worry about their transaction going to fail. How fast and secure is "Gear Technologies' platform? If the number of users spikes, will transactions on "Gear Technologies' get congested?**

  Gear architecture aims for high throughput -- it uses WASM VM under the hood which means near-native code execution speed, fast and low-cost transactions. For inter-program (contracts) interactions, Gear uses the actor model for communications approach, which is parallelizable and shardable by design.This also allows to utilize various language constructs for asynchronous programming (for example, Futures and async-await in Rust) which significantly streamline asynchronous processing of transactions.

- _1006._ **If the community is considered the backbone, security is also an extremely important factor. So is your project currently audited or not? How to convince that your security system is safe enough for investors as well as the community against hacker attacks?**

  At current stage, we make our protocol feature-complete. After that we will undergo a security and economical audit. Our stable test network (stand-alone) will be launched right after this audit. Bug-bounty program is also one of our priorities -- it will be permanent.

- _1007._ **Once the product is developed, one of the main challenges seems to be adoption. What are some of the plans to stimulate adoption and build out the ecosystem around GearTech?**

  Thanks for the question! We are planning to become a Kusama and Polkadot parachain, which will allow us and all who will be connected to the Gear platform to benefit from all the advantages of these ecosystems. Also, the entry expenses for using the Gear platform will be much lower because there is no need to lease an own parachain as Gear automatically performs parallel sourcing of parachain slots. So using Gear is much cheaper than leasing parachain slots, which is a major benefit for standalone projects.

- _1008._ **Security is always a concern as well as determining the success of each project! With #GearTech, what partners do you have to improve security for investors? Are there any compensation policies if they are unfortunately misappropriated?**

  Currently, we’re making our protocol feature-complete. After that we will undergo a security and economical audit. As long as Gear is a proposed Kusama/ Polkadot parachain - we also guarantee the resistance of attacks with pooled security of Polkadot/Kusama. Bug-bounty program is also one of our priorities -- it will be permanent.

- _1009._ **Where can I buy token? Will it be less expensive or more expensive? Possible all links to all your social media platforms if possible?**

  We are not going to have an open token sale, but you can earn our tokens by taking part in our workshops, hackathons and other events. Please feel free to join our community on Twitter, Medium and Discord! We are constantly announcing new future events, so you will have a chance to get involved and learn something new!

- _1010._ **Many new projects develop well at first, but then fail to achieve good results. How will you manage and develop your project to gain a position in the market and become a good project in the blockchain industry?**

  Thanks for the question! We are planning to become a Kusama and Polkadot parachain, which will allow us and all who will be connected to the Gear platform to benefit from all the advantages of these ecosystems. Also, the entry expenses for using the Gear platform will be much lower because there is no need to lease an own parachain as Gear automatically performs parallel sourcing of parachain slots. So using Gear is much cheaper than leasing parachain slots, which is a major benefit for standalone projects.

- _1011._ **Crypto people say that the next boom will on NFT after the Defi, Do you agree with this? And what are the plans of "Gear Technologies' to build on NFT concept/Technology ? Any future idea about NFT?**

  Gear is a smart contract platform that enables developers to build anything that they want. Developers that’ll be using Gear could easily build NFT`s if they would like to!

- _1012._ **Could you explain to us in simple terms what is the purpose of "Gear Technologies' ? What is the strongest advantage that you think will make this team lead the market? How will you attract investors and build the trust and win the hearts of millions of people in your project?**

  In simple terms, we would like to make the life of developers easier. Our platform not only caters to Solidity developers, but all developers - even those who are only familiar with general purpose programming languages. They will be able to write a smart contract in a very short time and in the most cost-effective way. Gear provides pre-built secure solutions but also the freedom to build from scratch using Rust.

- _1013._ **People are always worried about the transaction speed because they worry about their transaction going to fail. How fast and secure is "Gear Technologies' platform? If the number of users spikes, will transactions on "Gear Technologies' get congested?**

  Gear’s architecture aims for high throughput. It uses WASM VM under the hood which means near-native code execution speed, fast and low-cost transactions. For inter-program (contracts) interactions, Gear uses the actor model for communications approach, which is parallelizable and shardable by design. This also allows it to utilize various language constructs for asynchronous programming (for example, Futures and async-await in Rust) which significantly streamline asynchronous processing of transactions.

- _1014._ **Please explain what is the advantage of #GearTech over similar projects? How can you capture the most value from this nascent market for data governance, among others? How will that benefit your tokenholders?**

  Gear is a smart-contract platform allowing anyone to run dApp in a few minutes! Here are some of the advantages of developing on Gear.Programs (smart-contracts) run in WebAssembly VM, which provide near-native code execution speed. Parallelizable architecture (even greater speed). Actor model for message-passing communications - secure, effective, clear, parallelizable and shardable. Fast smart-contract development speed - build dApps in minutes using intuitive Gear libraries. Gear provides pre-built secure solutions but also the freedom to build from scratch using Rust.

- _1015._ **As I know, strong backing and partnerships in the crypto market might bring huge benefits to new projects. During this point, can you tell us about the investors and partners of your project ? What benefits to the "GearTech' ecosystem do you expect from them?**

  We are backed by top VCs and angels that are heavily involved in the industry and are eager to help us grow. Our investors mainly invest in infrastructure projects and typically hold their investment with a horizon of 5 years. They will share their wisdom and best practices from some of their previous experience of supporting and guiding some of the leading projects in the blockchain ecosystem.

- _1016._ **Building and giving trust to the community is one of the toughest challenges because of the many frauds and crimes happening in crypto today, how can you solve this problem and convince investors to invest?**

  We strongly believe that providing security to Gear’s users is one of our biggest priorities. Currently, we are making our protocol feature-complete. After that we will undergo a security and economical audit. As long as Gear is a proposed Kusama/ Polkadot parachain - we’ll also guarantee the resistance of attacks with pooled security of Polkadot/Kusama. Bug-bounty program is also one of our priorities. It will be permanent.

- _1017._ **Could you give an overview of $GRB Token tokenomics? Will the design of the token rise and fall with the success of the platform, does it include any scarce paths, such as equity, storage or burning?**

  GRB token is not our native token. This was made for rewards. It means Gear Bonus Token, but it can be exchanged for our native token. Now, we are in the process of developing a main tokenomics strategy. If you don't want to miss our updates feel free to join our community on Twitter, Discord or Medium!

- _1018._ **For development of a project, main priority is having enough fund. Does your team financially capable to run this project? Do you have enough fund for it's developement? Can you tell us that How your project generates the profit?**

  We are backed by top VCs and angels that are heavily involved in the industry and are eager to help us grow. Our investors mainly invest in infrastructure projects and typically hold their investment with a horizon of 5 years. They will share their wisdom and best practices from some of their previous experience of supporting and guiding some of the leading projects in the blockchain ecosystem. All information about our investors will become public in the near future.

- _1019._ **How is #GearTech planning to attract users and show that #GearTech is a tool with better underlying technology and easier, more intuitive development experience? What are the challenges you are trying to solve in the next 6-12 months?**

  Gear is a general-purpose platform for hosting advanced L2 smart contracts with securely running untrusted code in a shared memory environment, allowing a broad range of programs to run seamlessly with minimum to zero modifications in the blockchain context. The main goal is to make the life of developers easier by giving them ready-made solutions. Gear will open the doors to develop a new generation of DApps by its unique design and native security.Gear is written in Rust, a general-purpose programming language that’s one of the most flexible programming languages nowadays. Rust has many vital advantages for blockchain as well as for writing reliable code. Gear applies the WebAssembly module, which is widely used in blockchain projects when a virtual machine is necessary. All benefits of using Rust provide unity with WebAssembly. Gear uses the WebAssembly virtual machine, so programs compiled in different languages, such as C, C++ and other popular programming languages can be used to power dApps.The Gear network provides developers with low transaction costs, decentralized computing, high speed and security. In the upcoming year, we have a lot of plans in mind but the most important is becoming a parachain of both the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems.

- _1020._ **Read in your whitepaper that security is your priority concern. Your code is open sourced but is your platform audited and secure?**

  At the current stage, we make our protocol feature-complete. After that we will undergo a security and economical audit. As long as Gear is a proposed Kusama/ Polkadot parachain - we also guarantee the resistance of attacks with pooled security of Polkadot/Kusama. Bug-bounty program is also one of our priorities -- it will be permanent.

- _1021._ **When did Gear decide to roll out Gear Token Public Sale? Can you tell me how to participate in Gear public sale?**

  We are not planning to organize a public token sale, but you can earn our bonus token as a reward for taking part in our workshops, hakatons etc. All bonus tokens can be changed for native Gear tokens. If you want to stay up to date and always be the first to know about our upcoming events we will be glad if you will join our community on Twitter and Discord. https://discord.com/invite/7BQznC9uD9

- _1024._ **What do you think about the Asian market in crypto? Does your project have any plans in the future to go to ASEAN which is a potential market in crypto?**

  We believe that the Asian market plays a big role. We have part of our crew working in China. We are planning to organize events there and in Japan soon. We are also planning to expand our community into more Asian markets. We are growing fast and we are always looking for motivated and self driven people to join our company and support our community. So if you have any ideas on how we can improve, you are always welcome to send us an e-mail or speak to the crew in Discord https://discord.com/invite/7BQznC9uD9 .

- _1025._ **Gear Technologies currently resides in the Polkadot network. But, do you have plans to expand to other networks like Solana, BSC, ETH, etc?**

  The integration of a bridge in different chains is very useful for investors and their assets in terms of cost reduction in rates.When Gear becomes a Polkadot parachain, we will get access to its whole ecosystem as wil all the projects who will join Gear platform. As long as we will form a part of the Polkadot ecosystem we will have easy interaction with other networks through Polkadot`s bridges.

- _1026._ **if we want to stake and farm "Gear Technologies' , how will the profit be calculated? and will "Gear Technologies' cooperate with DEX AMMs from other projects such as Pancakeswap?**

  Gear is a platform for building smart contracts, it is not a product for end users, it is a platform for developers. We are a part of infrastructure aimed to help the developers save time and spend less. With our platform you can build projects like Pancakeswap or any project that comes to your mind, like making your own token, NFTs, DAO, DEX etc.

- _1027._ **Could you tell us about the background and experience of Gear Technologies's development team? How will they carry out your project during this current pandemic?**

  Our core team is a team of high professionals who took part in developing Polkadot, Kusama and Substrate. They all specialize in Rust so they all have immense experience and knowledge behind them. Our code is open for everyone, check out our contributions in GitHub https://github.com/gear-tech , you can see all our development process there.

- _1028._ **The N-Covid epidemic is affecting the entire world economy and "Gear Technologies' is no exception. So, how does the disease affect "Gear Technologies'? Do you have a plan to reduce the damage caused by Covid?**

  Our work is mostly remote, but there’s still one problem – holding offline events sometimes has become difficult. However, we are dealing with it well while also holding online events too.

- _1029._ **Hackers are very active in the market and almost everyday we hear about another hack attack. Can you please give some information about the security system of "Gear Technologies'? How safe are the funds of investors? Do you already have an audit.**

  Currently, we are making our protocol feature-complete. After that we will undergo a security and economical audit. As long as Gear is a proposed Kusama/ Polkadot parachain, we will also guarantee the resistance of attacks with pooled security of Polkadot/Kusama. Bug-bounty program is also one of our priorities. It will be permanent.

- _1030._ **Please introduce Gear in the most concise way.**

  Gear is a smart contract platform which will become a parachain on the Polkadot and Kusama network. It's the most advanced WASM smart contract platform in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem that enables developers to deploy decentralized applications in the easiest and most efficient ways possible. On Gear's platform, all smart contracts are WebAssembly programs that are compiled from different programming languages such as Rust/C/C++ and others. This lowers the barrier to entry for developers that are not so familiar with blockchain development because they can build dApps in programming languages that they are more familiar with.If you want to learn more about our platform you can have a look at these articles:https://medium.com/@gear_techs/introducing-gear-easy-to-use-polkadot-parachain-9ccd05437a9c https://medium.com/@gear_techs/the-advantage-of-gear-technology-6477315e9ba

- _1031._ **Can you talk about your experience in Parity? What experience did you learn from and can be used on Gear?**

  In Parity, we’ve built a lot of things even before Polkadot. We began as an ethereum ecosystem project, in fact. There were times when Ethereum was working only because of the parity-ethereum node being resistant to DoS attacks. We also build lesser-known solutions such as parity-bitcoin and parity-zcash, fully implementing the Bitcoin and Zcash protocols. We were interested in WebAssembly since it first appeared, both contributing to its general adoption and its blockchain one. We’ve built and deployed the first network that was utilizing WebAssembly as a virtual machine for smart-contracts (user code). Parity development culture is also quite special - full of meritocracy and self-guided work, which I believe is essential when building something that was never built before.

- _1032._ **Polkadot already has several chains that support smart contracts, such as Acala, Moonbeam and Astar. Why do we still need Gear?**

  Gear operates with substantially lower transaction costs, higher speed, and superior flexibility due to its WebAssembly VM when compared to Moonbeam. Additionally, unlike any other smart-contract platform, Gear scales with the amount of cores a typical validator on the network has (code execution architecture is parallelizable by design).

- _1033._ **Why did you choose Web Assembly contract. Will EVM compatibility be considered in the future?**

  Gear uses WebAssembly (or WASM) under the hood. Any Gear program is in WebAssembly format. WebAssembly is a code format for deploying programs. In Gear’s context, any smart-contract is a WebAssembly program. WebAssembly has the following advantages：Native speed. As it translates to actual hardware instructions. Portable. It can run on any actual hardware. Safe. Properly validated WebAssembly program cannot leave sandbox (guaranteed by specification). WebAssembly is a global industrial technology, remarkable for many reasons: It has been designed and implemented in collaboration between all major competitors in its space. It has been designed and released along with a complete mathematical, machine-verified formalisation.

- _1034._ **What do you think is the key point for a smart contract platform to attract developers? What will you do accordingly to build your own developer ecosystem?**

  We need to understand that the amount of developers in the blockchain spaces is still limited. We try to lower the barrier to entry for building and deploying smart contracts by enabling developers who are less familiar with blockchain development to use common languages that are already popular and used all over the world such as Rust, C, C++. Plus we are now developing a lot of templates and libraries for different applications so that a developer can actually choose a preexisting template and by changing several parameters easily deploy their dapp. In October，2021，we launched our educational project and started a series of workshops in different locations in Russia and in the USA, soon we will hold one in China and Turkey. We started focusing a lot of our effort in building a strong community of people that will be interested in developing and joining the blockchain ecosystem. We will be launching a grant program soon, as well as the ambassadors one. We also are launching an educational page, where we will guide developers on how they can start building their dApps with different examples.

- _1035._ **What is the current stage of Gear? When are going to bid for Polkadot and Kusama Parachain slot?**

  For now, we are finalizing our stable test network. After that, we will be running an independent security and economic audit in order to deploy on the Kusama network. We are expecting to do so in Q1 2022. Regarding Polkadot auctions the decision would be taken after we finalize our deployment on the Kusama network. For now we have somewhere in Q3 of 2022 in mind.

- _1036._ **At this stage, how can developers and the community participate in Gear?**

  We are an open-source platform, all our code is available for the public in our GitHub, community can check our contributions there https://github.com/gear-tech . In GitHub, developers can find the main Gear component, Gear node, a set of tools for interacting with a Gear node and a library for developing smart contracts.

## Technical
- _2001._ **Is Gear's Actor parallel model similar to Solana's Sealevel parallel model?**

  Technically they have different approaches but aim for the same goal - parallel processing of multiple transactions. Sealevel is based on interfaces that tell the kernel ahead of time all the memory the user wants to read or write. This allows the OS to prefetch, prepare the device, and execute the operation concurrently if the device allows it. On Solana, each instruction tells the VM which accounts it wants to read and write ahead of time. This is the root of their optimizations to the VM. It allows to sort millions of pending transactions and schedule all the non-overlapping transactions in parallel. Note: Solana’s Sealevel was introduced 2 years ago and looks abandoned https://github.com/solana-labs/sealevel. Gear uses message passing communication model between actors. Each program (actor) has an individual isolated memory space which allows parallelization of message processing on a Gear node. Number of parallel processing streams equals the number of node’s CPU cores. Gear engine divides the total amount of targeted programs to the number of streams and creates a message pool for each stream. All messages addressed to a particular program appear in a single processing stream.

- _2002._ **How does Gear's multi-threaded/parallel mode avoid frequent rollbacks and confusion ( Whether the multiple threads in a process should be written into the same block)?**

  When a Gear validator node comes to produce a new block, some (or all) transactions from the transaction pool are merged into a block. In a parallel model, several transactions from several streams can appear in the same block. Transactions that were not taken in the last block remain in the pool until the next block is produced.

- _2003._ **What are the difficulties in the implementation of the Actor model and the multi-threading as well as the parallel mechanism? How did the Gear team overcome these difficulties?**

  There are no difficulties in particular, we just need to have a well thought out architecture. Potential complexity of parallel processing might be related with determinism, since different nodes have a different number of CPU cores. It will be overcomed via the development of the special cutting edge algorithms.

- _2004._ **Does Gear support most of Rust's native features (like async/await, etc.)?**

  yes, Gear natively provides custom `std` functions including arbitrary async/await syntax for any programs. Also everything non-std is supported as well as unit/integration tests.

- _2005._ **Does Gear now support writing contracts in C language? Are there any other compatibility solutions in the future? Will Gear consider EVM compatibility?**

  Gear allows to run WebAssembly programs compiled from many popular languages, such as C/C++, Rust etc. Regarding EVM compatibility, Gear’s programs will be able to interact with programs running on EVM machines in different networks when Gear becomes a Polkadot parachain.

- _2006._ **Can we run the node now?**

  Running the Gear node is the same as running the BTC and ETH nodes. There is non limitation for that.

- _2007._ **Are there rewards for running nodes?**

  There are no rewards for running nodes

- _2008._ **What are the benefits of running Gear nodes?**

  What are the benefits for individuals to run ETH and BTC nodes? What you can get is the same as running Gear. As an ecosystem, decentralization can be increased. As individuals, transactions can be verified independently, but there is no obvious financial incentive for individuals.

- _2029._ **What's the difference between Solidity and Gear contracts?**

  The message mechanism of Gear is different from that of Solidity. Solidity requires nonce to ensure the execution order with a single account. Gear does not need this as long as you have enough gas.

- _2030._ **Do you have any material about WASM to share?**

  Yes, u need to claim test token for testing

- _2036._ **are the tests that can be taken at the moment only  in the road of Testnet?**

  u can test on the link  https://idea.gear-tech.io/ or on your local node

- _2037._ **I can see NEAR blockchain also uses WASM compiled smart contracts, making it compete in the same space. However, as a Polkadot parachain, Gear would benefit from the Polkadot relay chain. Has such a comparison has been made yet? I don't mean jumping straight into "competitor analysis" as a means to bash NEAR in any way, I think it can help people understand more about the tech.**

  Besides Gear also will have access to all relay chain ecosystem (messaging to parachains and bridges), Gear also has completely different architecture under the hood. First, Gear programs don’t call each other synchronously, they exchange messages that will be processed (and replied) in future. Second, there is no key-value storage api for gear programs and subsequent user api — for Gear program, all state (memory pages) is saved automatically. All of these makes Gear parallelizable and shareable by design.

- _2038._ **So substrate wasm support does not mean that you can write smart contracts in different programming languages such as C++? What does substrate wasm support mean then? That you can create a blockchain in those languages?**

  Wasm support doesn't mean smart contract development environment support. Under the hood, substrate uses WASM implementation of some consensus pieces required for forkless updates, etc. It is used as a technology. You can read more on that here: https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-wasm To be a little more specific, we use Substrate's support for WASM in order to create a full smart contract development environmen.

  We are using Statemine to reward active members of our community with the GEAR Bonus Token (GRB) - which in the future can be exchanged for native GEAR tokens. GRB token is not our native token. This was made for rewards. It means Gear Bonus Token, but it can be exchanged for our native token. If you don't want to miss our updates feel free to join our community on Twitter, Discord or Medium!

- _3029._ **do you have token available on marketcap now? Any link i can learn about Gear please? Thanks!**

  We don't have a token yet, but you can learn all about GEAR from our website at https://gear-tech.io/ For more detailed info you can also check out our wiki page here! https://wiki.gear-tech.io/

- _3030._ **I would like to understand in which batch of auctions you plan to declare your project? How will your token be distributed?**

  The questions you asked we don't have a public answer for just yet, stay tuned for more information!
